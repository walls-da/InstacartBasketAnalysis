# Instacart Basket Analysis
Exploratory analysis on (fictional) Instacart data for user-data segmentation to improve marketing strategies.
## Project Overview
To improve sales, data was seperated and analyzed based on categories such as, location, amount spent, busiest time of day and week, and product types. Data was aggregated with Jupyter Notebook using pandas and numpy. Visualizations were made using matplotlib and seaborn. Insights on marketing strategies were gleamed from the data segmentation and visualiztions to more accurately target customer profiles and products.

## Questions

● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● Are there any particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● What is a simpler more efficient price range grouping?

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
